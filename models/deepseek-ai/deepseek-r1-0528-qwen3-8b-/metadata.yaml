      enUS: The DeepSeek R1 model has undergone a minor version upgrade, with the
        current version being DeepSeek-R1-0528. In the latest update, DeepSeek R1
        has significantly improved its depth of reasoning and inference capabilities
        by leveraging increased computational resources and introducing algorithmic
        optimization mechanisms during post-training. The model has demonstrated outstanding
        performance across various benchmark evaluations, including mathematics, programming,
        and general logic.
